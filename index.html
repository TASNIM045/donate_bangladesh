            <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">1. Why do floods happen?</div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>Floods occur due to excessive water accumulation in an area, surpassing the capacity of drainage
                    systems. The main causes include heavy rainfall, river overflow, dam failure, and rapid snowmelt.
                    Climate change also plays a crucial role, leading to unpredictable weather patterns and extreme
                    rainfall. Deforestation increases flood risks as trees absorb water and slow down its flow.
                    Urbanization contributes by replacing natural ground with concrete, preventing water absorption.
                    Poor drainage systems in cities make the problem worse. In coastal areas, storms and tsunamis can
                    cause floods. Human activities, such as improper waste disposal, can clog drainage systems, leading
                    to water stagnation. Some regions are naturally prone to flooding due to their geography, like river
                    basins or low-lying coastal areas. Effective flood management, such as building dams, maintaining
                    drainage systems, and planting trees, can help reduce risks. Understanding these causes is essential
                    for developing strategies to prevent future floods.</p>

            <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">2. What are the different types of floods?</div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>Floods are categorized based on their causes and impact. The most common type is river flooding,
                    occurring when rivers overflow due to heavy rainfall or melting snow. Flash floods happen suddenly
                    due to intense rain in a short period, often in urban or mountainous areas. Coastal flooding occurs
                    when storm surges, hurricanes, or tsunamis push seawater onto land. Pluvial floods, or surface water
                    floods, occur in cities when drainage systems fail, causing water to accumulate on streets.
                    Groundwater floods happen when underground water levels rise due to prolonged rain, causing flooding
                    in low-lying areas. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) occur when a glacier-dammed lake overflows,
                    releasing large amounts of water. Each type of flood has different consequences and requires unique
                    prevention strategies. Governments and communities must understand these types to prepare and
                    implement effective flood control measures, such as better urban planning and emergency response
                    systems.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>Floods have severe consequences on human life, affecting people physically, emotionally, and
                    economically. The most immediate impact is the loss of lives and injuries caused by drowning or
                    collapsing buildings. Floods damage homes, roads, and bridges, leading to homelessness and
                    displacement. Water contamination during floods spreads diseases like cholera, typhoid, and
                    dysentery. The agricultural sector suffers as floodwaters destroy crops, leading to food shortages
                    and economic losses for farmers. Businesses and industries shut down, resulting in unemployment and
                    financial crises. Education is disrupted when schools are damaged or used as shelters. Mental health
                    issues, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, arise due to loss and uncertainty. Floods also have
                    long-term effects on infrastructure, requiring costly repairs. Governments and aid organizations
                    must provide relief, rebuild communities, and implement flood management strategies to minimize
                    future impacts. Raising awareness and preparing for floods can help reduce human suffering.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>Flood preparedness and mitigation strategies can significantly reduce damage and save lives. One
                    effective method is building strong drainage systems and maintaining rivers to prevent overflow.
                    Constructing dams and reservoirs helps control water flow. Afforestation, or planting trees, helps
                    absorb excess rainwater, reducing runoff. In flood-prone areas, houses should be built on elevated
                    platforms or stilts. Early warning systems, such as weather forecasts and sirens, allow people to
                    evacuate in time. Governments must develop strict urban planning policies, ensuring that cities have
                    proper drainage and flood barriers. People should prepare emergency kits with food, water, and
                    medical supplies. During floods, avoiding contact with floodwater prevents infections. Community
                    awareness programs educate people on safety measures, such as moving to higher ground and switching
                    off electrical appliances. Disaster response teams should be well-equipped for rescue operations. By
                    combining these efforts, we can significantly reduce the risks and impacts of floods.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>Climate change significantly increases the frequency and severity of floods worldwide. Rising global
                    temperatures cause more evaporation, leading to heavier rainfall and intense storms. Warmer air
                    holds more moisture, resulting in prolonged and intense downpours that overwhelm drainage systems
                    and riverbanks. Melting glaciers and polar ice caps contribute to rising sea levels, making coastal
                    areas more vulnerable to flooding. Extreme weather events like hurricanes and cyclones become more
                    powerful, bringing massive storm surges that flood cities. Deforestation, caused by human activities
                    and climate shifts, reduces the land’s ability to absorb excess water, increasing surface runoff.
                    Additionally, changing weather patterns disrupt traditional rainfall cycles, causing floods in areas
                    that were previously dry. To mitigate these effects, governments must take action by reducing
                    greenhouse gas emissions, implementing better urban planning, and restoring natural ecosystems like
                    wetlands. Individuals can help by reducing their carbon footprint and supporting sustainable
                    environmental policies.

            <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">6. What role do human activities play in causing floods?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>Human activities significantly contribute to the increasing frequency and intensity of floods.
                    Urbanization replaces natural land with concrete, reducing the soil’s ability to absorb rainwater,
                    leading to waterlogging and flash floods. Deforestation removes trees that help absorb excess
                    rainfall and prevent soil erosion, allowing floodwaters to spread rapidly. Poor waste management
                    clogs drainage systems, causing water to overflow onto streets and homes. Unplanned construction
                    near rivers and coastal areas disrupts natural water flow, making these regions more prone to
                    flooding. Additionally, industrial activities and fossil fuel consumption contribute to climate
                    change, increasing extreme weather events and rising sea levels. Dam failures, often caused by poor
                    maintenance or excessive water accumulation, can lead to catastrophic flooding. To reduce
                    human-induced flooding, cities must improve drainage infrastructure, enforce sustainable
                    construction practices, and implement strict environmental regulations. Public awareness and
                    responsible behavior can also help mitigate the impact of human activities on flooding.</p>
